 * [*Textbook Online Database Environments:*](https://www.pdbmbook.com/playground) Example MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j databases we will use at various times.
 * [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
 * [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) - Read this first!
 * [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) - Read Second.
 * [GitHub CheatSheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
 * More readings and resources in the *Resources* folder of this repo

## Computers and Software
 * You will need a computer daily in class. I can bring some laptops if needed from Boone (so some warning would be good). School laptops may not have SQLite editors installed.
 * You will also need software to execute SQL queries on an SQLite DB. Here are some options:<br>
  - [ ] [sqlite studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/): Has some problems on Mac
  - [ ] [atom+quick-query](https://atom.io): The atom text editor and the *quick-query* package. Has great GitHub integration.
  - [ ] [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/): Commercial with free educational use. Prior students with Mac's have liked this.
  - [ ] [SQLite CLI](): The straight CLI interface for SQLite, it works but seeing query results in a console sucks.
  - [ ] [RStudio](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu): Use the College's RStudio server, or install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com) your own desktop version.

## Course Content
This course will be organized around answering the following questions:

* What is a database?
* Why do we need databases?
* What is a relational database?
* What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
* How do different DBMSs compare?
* How do you access or retrive information from a database?
* How do you insert or delete information from a database?
* How do you create a database?
* How do you design a database?
* How do relational and standard programming languages interact?
* What is noSQL and why is it useful?

We will cover chapters 1-11, parts of 15, and, time permitting, parts of 17-20 of the course text.

## Assignments
There will be a mid-term and final in this class as well as quizzes, homework and a project. You will be graded on in-class participation as well.

### In-Class Activities
Most class sessions will be spent working in pairs on activities and open-ended questions. These are activities to help you explore and develop key ideas related to databases for yourself and provide peer feedback. Your partner(s) should be an asset during these activities and you should be prepared to share your groups progress and accomplishments on each activity with the rest of the class. The primary goal is to help each other learn and deepen your understanding, this requires curiosity, respect for others, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. Sometimes you will be required to complete these tasks, or parts of them, outside of class to prepare for the next meeting. These activities will count towards your grade, so attending class and being actively involved in the tasks and discussions is important.

**Attendance Make-up** If you miss class, you may still receive points by submitting a non-trivial SQL query accompanied with a description of (a) how the query was created and (b) why it is of interest. Such queries must refer to databases we have not used extensively in class prior to your submission.

### Homework
We will have roughly weekly assignments that will require you to use ideas and skills discussed in class.  These assignments will grow in complexity through-out the semester. The due date and time for each assignment will be included in the assignment. At that time, or shortly after, I will pull your GitHub Homework repository for grading. Any subsequent changes you make will not be seen and hence not graded unless you talk to me. Late work will have a $25\%$ penalty per day (or any part thereof), it is your responsibility to commit and push changes to homework in a regular fashion before it is due.

### Project
You will complete a project that requires the design and comparison of a database system (or two). More details will follow once you know how to do this.

### Quizzes
 We will have approximately bi-weekly quizzes. This will be short, in class quizzes focusing on definitions, basic concepts, and small problems.

### Exam and Final
 You will have one mid-term exam this semester and a comprehensive
final exam. The structure and topics of each
exam will be discussed prior to the examination date, but they will be
held in class. There will be **no makeup exams** and alternate
dates or times
will only be arranged for participants in University sponsored
activities that prevent those students from being in class, or extreme
extenuating circumstances. Students with disabilities or students
participating in University sponsored activities should inform
me of the conflict ASAP (athletes and those with disabilities should
inform me early in the semester).

## Grade Scale
The following scale will be used to determine your letter grade:<br>

Min. Grade | Overall Percentage Range
------|--------------------
A-     | 100% - 90.0%
B-     | 89.99% - 80.0%
C-     | 79.99% - 70.0%
D-     | 69.99% - 60.0%
F     | 59.99% - 00.0%


## Disability Accommodations
The College of Idaho seeks to provide an educational environment that is sensitive to the needs of students with disabilities. The College provides reasonable services to enrolled students who have a documented permanent or temporary physical, mental, or sensory disability that qualifies the student for academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Students with disabilities are encouraged to notify the College of potential ADA or 504 status during the admission process.

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation must first request an official letter from the College's Learning Support and Disability Services Office and should then provide this letter to the instructor during the first week of class.

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to execute all the academic work with the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Students should foster integrity and social responsibility in the college community, and should not tolerate academic misconduct by others in the college community.

Cheating on assignments, as well as plagiarism (using other's writing, work, or idea and claiming it as your own) will result in your failing and being referred to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. See the College Catalog for information about Academic Misconduct.
